# Intersection Vehicle Simulation

3D simulation of vehicles crossing a perpendicular intersection, developed to depict interactions between multiple agents.

The simulation was created using Unity and involves 3 types of agents:
- Vehicles
- Pedestrians
- Traffic lights

In the backend, the Agent-based modeling framework Mesa was employed, complemented by a Flask-based API running on an IBM Cloud service.

For a more detailed explanation of how the simulation works and a final demonstration, please refer to this video: [Simulation Demonstration](https://youtu.be/kIqrypmB-GY)
